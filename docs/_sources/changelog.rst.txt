.. admonition:: **Major changes**
  :class: warning

  Even if it's a minor release, this version represents a major change for the project; the
  package has been mostly rewritten in order to implement page object model design pattern in a
  more efficient way (using type annotation).

  Besides, some functionalities have been removed with a view to limit the number of features
  during the beta phase.

  All previous versions should be considered as deprecated.


Changed
^^^^^^^
- :py:mod:`~manen.page_object_model` has been entirely rewritten to use type annotation instead
  of ``Element``. Note that some elements like select or radio button haven't been implemented in
  this new version yet (but will be in the future).
- Most of the documentation pages have been rewritten and improved.
- Most modules have better typing annotations and documentation. Besides, the code has been
  improved to be more syntactically correct.
- Manen no longer has optional dependencies (they were in fact development dependencies).
- The minimal version of Python required is now 3.10.
- Internally, rye is now used a project manager, and the linting and formatting relies on ruff.

Removed
^^^^^^^
- The module ``manen.resource`` and everything related (like the CLI) have been removed. Indeed,
  the official Selenium manager provides the same functionalities, and is available in recent
  versions of Selenium.
- ``manen.browser.BraveBrowser`` has been removed because it had a dependency on the module
  ``manen.resource``. Besides, it was considered as not enough tested internally to make it
  available publicly.

  needed by Selenium. It allows for example to download the drivers, executable
  required to launch a WebDriver.

  and :py:class:`~manen.browser.BraveBrowser`, an enhanced Selenium WebDriver.
- :py:mod:`~manen.page_object_model` is the implementation of `page object
  model <https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/test_practices/encouraged/page_object_models/>`_
  described in Selenium documentation. Thanks to that, you can describe and
  interact with the DOM structure through Python classes.
- a :py:mod:`~manen.cli` is shipped with the initial release in order to download
  drivers files.
