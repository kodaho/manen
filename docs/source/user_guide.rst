User Guide
==========

This part of the section helps you to get the most of ``manen``. By following the different
guides, you will get familiar with main features of the package.

The first user guide will show you how to manage the resources needed to launch a Selenium
or ``manen`` application (mainly automatically donwload the required drivers executable).
Next one explains the plus of using a ``Browser`` compared to a
:py:class:`~selenium.webdriver.remote.webdriver.WebDriver`. The last one details how to
implement the page object model using ``manen``.
